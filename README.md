FarmBot is an open-source precision agriculture technology project aimed at changing the way traditional agriculture is practiced. 
It allows users to precisely control planting, watering, fertilizing, and weeding processes to achieve self-sufficiency in food.
 Connected via the internet, FarmBot enables users to remotely manage their gardens or farms, optimizing plant growth conditions while reducing resource waste.

## Project Introduction

![Ax8](https://neroteam.com/blog/pages/flir-ax8-vulnerability-report/flir-1.jpg?m=1673082924)

In this project, we introduce a FLIR AX8 thermal imaging camera to the FarmBot system to enhance its monitoring capabilities. 
The FLIR AX8 is an advanced thermal imaging camera capable of providing real-time temperature monitoring and thermal analysis. 
By integrating the FLIR AX8 camera into the FarmBot system, our goal is to enable users to remotely monitor the temperature conditions of their FarmBot farms in real-time, further optimizing plant growth environments, preventing diseases and pests, and improving crop production efficiency.
