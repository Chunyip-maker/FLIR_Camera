## Project Basic Information

![FarmBot](https://farm.bot/cdn/shop/files/DSC00260_2400x_87666fa7-02d0-41eb-9a12-0cc5938f39be_1200x600_crop_center.jpg?v=1600237043)

FarmBot is an open-source precision agriculture technology project aimed at changing the way traditional agriculture is practiced. 
It allows users to precisely control planting, watering, fertilizing, and weeding processes to achieve self-sufficiency in food.
 Connected via the internet, FarmBot enables users to remotely manage their gardens or farms, optimizing plant growth conditions while reducing resource waste.

## Project Introduction

![Ax8](https://neroteam.com/blog/pages/flir-ax8-vulnerability-report/flir-1.jpg?m=1673082924)

In this project, we introduce a FLIR AX8 thermal imaging camera to the FarmBot system to enhance its monitoring capabilities. 
The FLIR AX8 is an advanced thermal imaging camera capable of providing real-time temperature monitoring and thermal analysis. 
By integrating the FLIR AX8 camera into the FarmBot system, our goal is to enable users to remotely monitor the temperature conditions of their FarmBot farms in real-time, further optimizing plant growth environments, preventing diseases and pests, and improving crop production efficiency.

## Changelog

- **Sprint 1:**
  - **Project initialization and requirement gathering**: Established the project framework and gathered initial requirements from stakeholders. This foundational step ensured that the project was aligned with user needs and project objectives.
  - **Preliminary integration design for FarmBot and FLIR AX8 thermal imaging camera**: Developed a conceptual design for integrating the FLIR AX8 camera with the FarmBot system. This included evaluating potential technical challenges and proposing initial solutions to facilitate real-time temperature monitoring.
  - **Creation of GitHub repository and documentation structure**: Set up the project's GitHub repository, establishing a clear documentation structure to support collaborative development and project tracking. This setup included initial guides, technical documentation, and plans for future documentation updates.
  - **Challenges encountered**: Faced challenges in ensuring compatibility between FarmBot's existing software and the FLIR AX8 camera's data output formats. Through a collaborative effort, the team identified potential middleware solutions to bridge this gap.
  - **Next steps**: For the upcoming Sprint 2, the team plans to focus on developing a prototype for the FLIR AX8 integration, conducting initial tests to validate the integration concept, and refining the project's requirement documentation based on initial feedback.
